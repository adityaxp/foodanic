Ingredients:
- 1 cup of rice
- 1/2 cup of jaggery
- 1/4 tsp of cardamom powder
- 1/2 cup of grated coconut
- 1/4 cup of water
- 2 tbsp of ghee
- oil for deep frying

Step by step instructions:

1. Wash the rice and soak it in water for about 2 hours.

2. Drain the water and grind the rice into a fine powder.

3. Add grated coconut, jaggery, cardamom powder, and ghee to the rice powder mixture and mix well.

4. If the mixture is too dry, add a little water to it to make it into a thick dough.

5. Heat oil in a frying pan until it is hot enough for deep frying.

6. Take small portions of the dough and shape them into small balls.

7. Flatten each ball in the palm of your hand and shape it into a small disc.

8. Place the disc into the hot oil and fry until it turns golden brown.

9. Once done, remove the Poornalu from the oil and place them on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.

10. Repeat the process until you have fried all of your Poornalu.

11. Serve the Poornalu warm with a fresh cup of chai tea. 

Enjoy your Poornalu!
