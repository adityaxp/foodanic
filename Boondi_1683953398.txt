Boondi is a popular Indian snack made from chickpea flour batter that is deep-fried into small round droplets and then mixed with a variety of spices and chutneys. Here's a step-by-step recipe guide for making boondi:

Ingredients:
- 1 cup chickpea flour (besan)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 to 1 cup water
- Oil for deep frying

Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, add chickpea flour, salt and baking soda and mix well.
2. Add water gradually to make a smooth, lump-free batter. The consistency should be slightly thick but pouring consistency.
3. Heat oil in a deep-frying pan on medium-high heat.
4. Hold a boondi ladle or a perforated spoon over the hot oil and pour some batter over it.
5. Tap the spoon to let the boondis fall into the hot oil. Fry in small batches until the boondis turn crispy and golden brown.
6. Remove the fried boondis on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.
7. Repeat the above step until all the batter is used up.
8. Once the boondis have cooled down, transfer them to a mixing bowl.
9. For seasoning, add salt, red chili powder, chaat masala, and cumin powder to the boondis. Mix well.
10. Finally, add some chopped fresh cilantro and mint leaves to the boondis and mix again.
11. Serve the boondis as a snack or use it as a topping for your favorite chaat dishes.

Enjoy your homemade boondi on its own or as a garnish on your favorite Indian dishes.
